                Sub[turing]fuge is a multiplayer party game where the goal is to trick your friends
                into thinking you're an AI. When the game begins, you'll see the prompt entry
                screen.
            </p>
            <h4>Prompt Entry</h4>
            <p>
                All human players enter a prompt, one of which will be used in the upcoming round.
                What you enter here is what the AI (and other players pretending to be the AI) will
                respond to, so try to make sure it's comprehensible! You can even establish context
                for your prompt (for example, you could start your prompt with "You are an advanced
                AI whose goal is to...")
            </p>
            <p>After that, each round of the game consists of three phases:</p>
            <h4>Prompt Response</h4>
            <p>One of the prompts is picked, and the players and AI all answer it.</p>
            <h4>Guessing</h4>
            <p>
                All human players guess who said what! You won't be awarded any points for
                identifying your own response as yourself. (The AI doesn't do any guessing.)
            </p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>
                Who wrote what is revealed! If you correctly identified the AI's response, you get
                200 points, if you correctly identified a human player's response, you get 75
                points.
            </p>
            <p>
                If another player thinks your response was written by the AI, you receive 400
                points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, whenever the AI convinces a human player that its response was written by a
                human, it recieves 400 points.
            </p>
            <p>The game then continues, playing one round for each prompt submitted.</p>
            <h3>Good luck, humans!</h3>
